Project enLIGHTen was inspired by the theme of "Sustainability" and allows users to install an infared camera that can detect where people are in a room and turns lights on or off based on which zone people are in. The project uses machine learning and Tensor Flow Lite for person recognition, ESPs for each light toggling device, and a Rasberry Pi that connects to each switch and runs the TensorFlow algorithm. The project uses Firebase as its main database which commmunicates with a companion mobile app made with Swift UI.
